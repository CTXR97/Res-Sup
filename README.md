# Resistance and Support Levels 

Resistance and Support Levels based on Candlesticks using Python

A fractal is a candlestick pattern made by 5 candles. The third candle has the lowest low price, the previous candles have decreasing lows and the next candles have increasing lows. By this pattern, the low of the third candle is the support level. The same concept applies to resistance levels, where the third candle has the highest high of the five ones.

Therefore what the code aims to do is to identify these pivots and draw a support and resistance. The first graph will end up like this:
